                                        The Website challenged me and made me go out of my comfort zone to try and bring something new to me. It didnâ€™t turn out to be perfect, but the effort and thoughts incorporated into it was not a waste. A pleasurable experience regardless of all the ups and downs encountered. I feel that it is " Growth in Progress" and the Website experience was a steppingstone to greater purpose.

                                        Project Name: S.S.M.S
                                        <br><br>
                                        Project Description: This website was an opportunity for students to interact despite the geghrapical distances that ocuured as a result of the pandemic that seperated us. It is a medium that inspires creativity and manifests an artistic collaboration.It transecnds all boundaries that are a byproduct of peoples's differences and unites their skills as one. The experience I was striving for is to establish a connection among people coming from differnt regions. All in all, this was a project that combined multiple minds to form a beautiful outcome.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Process: I started implementing it by previewing the mini-story we had created in a very short time. The purpose was to show that our hearts are all connected together and thats by transceding a piece of clothes that is shared among the actors. Moving on, I wanted the readers to get an overview on the actors charcters briefly. Fianally, I incorporated other videos to show that everyone is welcome to share their ideas and that it is needed. Thus, the comment section was meant for people to interact and share their perspectives.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Reflection/Evaluation: The shift of the project from Wirefram to an actual website was more challenging than I had expected. It was a chance for me to delve deeper into web development and explore various aspects of it. From my perspective, I have put in much time and effort into building this website and I am satisfied with the outcome. Due to the limited time I had with almost no prior experience or background in this field, ,I had higher expectation of what I would of been able to accomplish in this website. For example, I would have prefered it to be more visually appealing and create stories from the mini-films shared. The hardships that I have faced were mostly with the patterns and positioning of the boxes. In other words, the structure and synch of the website. I kept playing alot with the values for positioning and that would affect the format of the page. Moving on, when I fixed all the position , then tried to open the tab in full screen , I noticed that the boxes shifted because I had to center everything from the start. Yet, Im very happy I went through this, beacause at least I learned from my mistakes. Moreover, something I would of wanted to illustrate more is the question " Does everything come togther"? I think for the future, I would have to think more of what compliments the meaning of a useful and good website.
